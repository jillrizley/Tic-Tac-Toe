**Development Process**
Aside from our project study, I began by thinking about the different specs that were necessary and how to start breaking down the issues involved in creating the game.

I started with the basic board and quickly attempted to jump into the javascript logic to make the game work. I had a lot of difficulty crafting the functions to make everything work so far!

We had just learned about the login credentials, so fresh on my mind, it was not too complicated to get that in motion for this new project.

I did my best to meet the requierment, but given the time and the help I feel as though I needed I didn't quite make it there, although I am proud of the project I have so far.

**Unsolved problems**
Creating a cats game, new game button that does more than just refresh the page, the API for the game part of the project, playing multiple games at a time...all of which I look forward to implimenting.
