**Development Process**
I started this project by thinking about the different specifications that were necessary to create a fully functioning tic-tac-toe game. That began with breaking down the game into individual parts and focussing on how to make each of them work indiviually before putting everything together to create the game.

I started with creating the board itself and then jumped into the javascript logic. While difficult, I was able to make the game work as planned!

I am very proud of the project I have build so far, I have learned a lot and I hope to keep editing and adding to this project as I continue to learn more techniques.

**Unsolved problems**
playing multiple games at a time, creating a more user friendly interface
